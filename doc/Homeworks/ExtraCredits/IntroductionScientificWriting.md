# Introduction to Scientific Writing

Writing scientific reports is an important part of the scientific process.  If a scientist cannot effectively communicate what they have done to the rest of the field, then their works will not be recognized.  All scientific reports contain the following sections, though they may have different headings or no headings at all (this is especially common in a short type of scientific report called a letter).  Nevertheless, most scientific reports are structured to follow the given flow of information.  To get a better idea of what a published scientific paper looks like see [Example 1](Example1.pdf), [Example 2](Example2.pdf), and [Example 3](Example3.pdf) (don't worry if you don't understand the contents, just look at the formatting).

## Components of a Scientific Report

This is the typical order information will appear in most scientific reports

#### Title and Authors

The title of a research paper should be descriptive of the research being done and not too long.  Catchy titles are ok as long as there is a subtitle that more fully describes what the paper is about.  The authors can be listed in alphabetical order or in the order of amount contributed (from most to least).

#### Abstract

An abstract is the very first section of a scientific paper.  It is not longer than a paragraph but it needs to describe the motivation for the scientific investigation, how the investigation was carried out, and what the important results are.  The abstract is arguably the most important part of a scientific paper because it is the first part the reader sees.  In addition, when applying presenting work at a conference, the only part of a scientific work submitted in the application is the abstract.  It is important that an abstract is not only well written, it convinces the reader that the work performed is complete and contributes to the scientific community.

####  Introduction

The Introduction is the second section of a paper, and the first part of the main body.  This is also typically the longest section of the paper.  This section explains any background knowledge that the reader needs to understand the scientific work and should also explain the motivation behind the work (why was this investigation performed and what does it add to the scientific community?).  Sometimes this is split into two sections: "Introduction" which contains the motivation of the paper, and "Background", which explains any needed background information, such as equations, theory, numerical analysis methods, etc.

#### Methods

The methods section explains the experimental set-up if the paper is on a scientific experiment or the software set-up if the paper is a numerical experiment (like in this class).  For a software methods section, the programming language should be listed along with any common libraries that were used.  If any common numerical methods are used, for example Euler's or Newton's Methods, state what they were used for here.  It is also common to see hardware specifications, especially if timing data is presented.

#### Results and Discussion

The results and discussions section is where the results and outcomes of an experiment are displayed, but also analyzed.  Sometimes this is one big section, and other times it is split into two separate sections.  Just showing the results is not usually helpful, so in this section the results are explained and any conclusions that can be drawn from the data are laid out.  Results and data are normally presented in graphs or tables, with important results being summarized in the text.

#### Conclusion

A conclusion is very similar to an abstract.  Here the main points and results of the paper are summarized and its usually in the conclusion where its analyzed if the results of the experiment support what was being investigated or not.  This section is usually no longer than two or three paragraphs.  Future works can also be listed here.

#### Acknowledgments

The acknowledgments section is a place to thank anyone who contributed to or helped with the study who is not an author.  If any funding was used in the study, this is the place to acknowledge the people or agencies who provided it.

#### References

Here all of the references are listed and numbered.  The first reference is the first one cited in the paper, the second reference is the second one cited, and so on.  References are citied in the text using the number of the reference in the list (see the example papers).  Typically the citations are sees as a number in brackets at the end of the sentence where the reference is relevant.  References are typically done in American Physics Society (APS) format.

### Other Aspects

#### Figures and Tables

Figures and tables can be useful at many points in a scientific report to better convey a point.  A picture is worth a thousand words after all.  Figures can be graphs, work flow diagrams. pictures of experimental set-ups, or any other needed visual.  Every figure and table in a paper needs both a label and a caption.  A label looks like **Figure 1** or **Table 1** and are how the figures and tables are referenced in the paper text.  They are numbered sequentially in order of appearance.  Captions are a brief paragraph that appears directly under the figure or table and explains what it depicts.

#### Equations

Equations are especially helpful in a physics paper to explain background information and calculations.  Equations appear centered on their own line and labeled with a number.  The equations are referred to in the text using that number.

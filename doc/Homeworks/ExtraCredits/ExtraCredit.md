# Classical Mechanics Extra Credit Assignment: Scientific Writing

The following gives you an opportunity yo earn five extra credit points on each of the remaining homeworks and ten extra credit points on the midterms and finals.  This assignment also covers an aspect of the scientific process that is not taught in most undergraduate programs: scientific writing.  Writing scientific reports is how scientist communicate their results to the rest of the field.  Knowing how to assemble a well written scientific report will greatly benefit you in you upper level classes, in graduate school, and in the work place.

This assignment allows you to gain extra credit points by practicing your scientific writing.  For each of the remaining homeworks you can submit the specified section of a scientific report (written about the numerical aspect of the homework) for five extra credit points on the assignment.  FOr the two midterms and the final, submitting a full scientific report covering the numerical analysis problem will be worth ten extra points.  For credit the grader must be able to tell that you put effort into the assignment (i.e. well written, well formatted, etc.).  If you are unfamiliar with writing scientific reports, see this article: [Introduction to Scientific Writing](IntroScienceWriting.md).

The following table explains what aspect of a scientific report is due with which homework.  You can submit the assignment in any format you like, in the same document as your homework, or in a different one.  Remember to cite any external references you use and include a reference list.  There are no length requirements, but make sure what you turn in is complete and through.  If you have any questions, please contact Julie Butler at butler@frib.msu.edu.
